To expedite our data delivery process, reduce testing cycles, and ensure end-to-end data quality, we propose the implementation of an automated Kafka message comparison utility. This tool will efficiently compare messages as they traverse the Landing Zone, Raw Zone, and Curated Zone. By automating this critical process, we can promptly identify and address data discrepancies, resulting in a shorter testing cycle, faster time to market, and a competitive edge. This initiative aims to streamline data validation, offer real-time monitoring, and maintain scalability, ultimately enhancing our data-driven capabilities.
