Assuming you have tables named Sheet1, Sheet2, and you want to filter records based on certain conditions, you might structure a SQL query as follows:-- Create a temporary table for filtered data
CREATE TABLE FilteredData AS
SELECT
    s1.*,
    CASE
        WHEN s1.CreatedDate IS NOT NULL THEN
            DATEADD(DAY, 1, DATEADD(MONTH, DATEDIFF(MONTH, 0, s1.CreatedDate), 0))
        ELSE
            NULL
    END AS AdjustedCreatedDate
FROM
    Sheet1 s1
JOIN
    Sheet2 s2 ON s1.Segment = s2.Segment
WHERE
    s1.J > 2000
    AND s1.K > 10000
    AND s1.TotalSale = s1.G * s1.E
    AND (s1.P = 2014 OR s1.P IS NULL);

-- Display the result
SELECT *
FROM FilteredData;This is a simplified example. Replace Sheet1 and Sheet2 with your actual table names, and adjust the conditions and column names based on your schema.
