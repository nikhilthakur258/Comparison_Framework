ISTQB or similar testing certification is a plus.



To convert XML to JSON in Java, you can use a library like Jackson, which provides support for both XML and JSON processing. You'll need to add the Jackson XML and Jackson Databind dependencies to your project. Here's a simple Java program that demonstrates how to convert XML to JSON:

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.XmlMapper;

public class XmlToJsonConverter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create an instance of ObjectMapper for XML and JSON
            ObjectMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper();
            ObjectMapper jsonMapper = new ObjectMapper();

            // Sample XML String
            String xml = "<person><name>John</name><age>30</age></person>";

            // Convert XML to JSON
            JsonNode jsonNode = xmlMapper.readTree(xml);
            String json = jsonMapper.writeValueAsString(jsonNode);

            // Print the JSON
            System.out.println("JSON representation of the XML:");
            System.out.println(json);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure you have the necessary Jackson dependencies in your project's build file. For example, if you are using Maven, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
        <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
        <version>2.13.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
        <version>2.13.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

This program reads an XML string, converts it to a JSON representation, and then prints the JSON output. You can replace the sample XML string with your own XML data for conversion.
